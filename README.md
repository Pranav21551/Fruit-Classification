We have developed and trained our model to classify a Kaggle dataset into categories of fruits. After using appropriate clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction algorithms were applied on the dataset. We then removed the outliers in the dataset and used classifiers with ensemble methods. Finally, k-fold cross validation technique was used to validate the model. The objective is to predict the category of fruits from a test dataset.

### Clustering Algorithms

* k-means Clustering after normalizing the dataset

### Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms

* Principal Component Analysis
* Linear Discriminant Analysis

### Outlier Dectection

* Local Outlier Factor

### Classification Models (combined using ensemble method)

* MLP Classifier
* Logistic Regression
